# 2024 Latest CMIVPS Coupon Codes - Organized Summary of CMIVPS Deals

## CMIVPS Introduction

CMIVPS has upgraded their Hong Kong VPS offerings, implementing the CN2 CIA network for improved performance (with backbone direct connection for outbound traffic and CN2 GIA for the return path). The hardware features dual Intel E5-2686v4 processors (2.3GHz base, 3.0GHz boost, 36 cores, 72 threads), DDR4 memory, and enterprise-grade SSD storage. Due to the high cost of CN2 bandwidth in Hong Kong, bandwidth options are limited to 3Mbps to 30Mbps, varying by configuration.
